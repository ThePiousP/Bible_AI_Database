atonement
new birth
born again
grace through faith
blood on the horns of the altar
it shall be accepted for him
to make atonement for him
died for our sins
bruised for our iniquities
wounded for our transgressions
him to be sin for us
the righteousness of God in him
just for the unjust
remission of sins
washed in his blood
