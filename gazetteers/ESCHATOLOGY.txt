abomination of desolation
ark of his covenant 
And then shall appear
and there shall be
as the days of Noah
as it was in the days of Noah
beast and false prophet
beginning of sorrows
coming of the Son of Man
day of Christ
day of the LORD
end of the age
end of days
end of the world
For there shall arise
Gog and Magog
great tribulation
judgment seat
kingdom against kingdom
lake of fire
last days
nation shall rise against nation
new heavens and new earth
new heaven and new earth
man of sin
mark of the beast
millennium
resurrection of the dead
second coming
sign of the Son of man
sign of thy coming
Son of man cometh
son of perdition
the end shall come
Then shall they
tribulation of those days
I will come again
there shall be signs
For many shall come
wars and rumours of wars
